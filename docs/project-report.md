# ProjectPulse: Modern Project Management System
Final Year Project Report

## Abstract
ProjectPulse is a comprehensive project management system built using modern web technologies. It provides role-based access control, real-time analytics, and robust project tracking capabilities, all wrapped in an intuitive dark-themed interface. The system is designed to improve team productivity and client engagement through transparent project tracking and collaborative features.

## 1. Introduction
### 1.1 Problem Statement
Traditional project management tools often lack real-time collaboration features and modern user interfaces, leading to decreased productivity and user engagement. Many existing solutions are complex, have steep learning curves, and fail to provide the real-time insights needed in today's fast-paced development environments.

### 1.2 Objectives
- Develop a scalable project management system
- Implement role-based access control
- Provide real-time analytics and reporting
- Create an intuitive, responsive user interface
- Support collaboration through comments and document sharing
- Enable transparent project tracking for all stakeholders

## 2. System Architecture
### 2.1 Technology Stack
- Frontend: Next.js 14, React, TailwindCSS, Shadcn/ui
- Backend: Next.js API Routes, Prisma ORM
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Authentication: NextAuth.js
- State Management: React Query
- Real-time Features: Socket.IO
- Testing: Jest, React Testing Library, Cypress

### 2.2 System Design
The system follows a modern full-stack architecture using Next.js 14 with the App Router. The architecture is visualized below:

```mermaid
graph TD
    C[Client Browser] --> F[Next.js Frontend]
    F --> A[App Router]
    A -->|API Calls| B[API Routes]
    B -->|CRUD| D[(Database)]
    B -->|Auth| E[Auth Service]
    E --> D
```

### 2.3 Project Structure
```

```

### 2.4 Database Schema
The database schema is designed to support the core features of project management with clear relationships between entities:

```mermaid
erDiagram
    User ||--o{ Project : "manages"
    User ||--o{ Task : "assigned"
    Project ||--o{ Task : "contains"
    Task ||--o{ Comment : "has"
    
    User {
        string id
        string email
        string name
        string role
        datetime createdAt
    }
    
    Project {
        string id
        string name
        string description
        datetime deadline
        string status
    }
    
    Task {
        string id
        string title
        string description
        string status
        datetime dueDate
        string priority
    }
