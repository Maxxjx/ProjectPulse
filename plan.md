Overview:
Develop "ProjectPulse" – a high-performance, scalable, and secure Project Management System using Next.js 14 (with the App Router) and modern web technologies. The system must have multi-role authentication (admin, team, client), robust API operations, dynamic dashboards, and real-time analytics—all wrapped in a sleek dark-themed UI (primary: #8B5CF6, background: #1F2937).

Development Approach:

Mock Data First:
Start with TypeScript interfaces and a mock data store for all entities (Users, Projects, Tasks, etc.).
Create utility functions that simulate CRUD operations on the mock data.
Finalize data requirements via the mock implementation, then migrate to a real database.
Phases to Implement:

Phase 1: Minimal Viable Product (MVP) [Completed]

Build a public landing page to advertise the product.
Include key features, testimonials, and a 'View Demo' button.
Ensure that clicking 'View Demo' redirects users to the login page with pre-populated sample credentials.
Phase 2: Authentication & Basic Dashboard [Completed]

Integrate NextAuth.js for login functionality (email and password based).
Implement JWT-based authentication.
Redirect authenticated users to a basic dashboard page.
Phase 3: Role-Based Dashboard Expansion [Completed]

Enhance the dashboard for multi-role access (admin, team, client).
Create role-specific pages or routes with customized content.
Implement a collapsible sidebar and a top header featuring the PMS logo, notifications, and user profile.
Phase 4: UI Consistency and Design System [Completed]

Implement a centralized theme system:
- Create a theme.ts file with color palette, typography, spacing, shadows, and more.
- Define CSS variables for consistent theming across light/dark modes.
- Add utility classes for common styling patterns.

Improve core UI components:
- Update Button component with consistent theming and variants.
- Enhance Card component with improved styling and hover effects.
- Create specialized DashboardCard component for metric displays.
- Update Input component to use the theme system.
- Create consistent Table component with proper styling.
- Implement ChartWrapper with theme-consistent chart styling.

Dashboard Layout Improvements:
- Update dashboard layout with consistent navigation.
- Create DashboardHeader and DashboardTabs components.
- Add DashboardEmptyState for better UX with empty data.
- Implement DataTable for consistent data presentation.
- Add proper mobile responsiveness and animations.

Phase 5: Core Features & API Integration [Completed]

Data Management:
- Define comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for all data models (User, Project, Task, etc.).
- Set up a mock data store with sample data for projects, tasks, users, etc.
- Develop mock service functions to simulate CRUD operations.
- Create hooks for data fetching (useUsers, useProjects, useTasks, etc.)

API Development:
- Create API endpoints under /api/auth/*, /api/projects/*, /api/tasks/*, /api/users/*, and /api/analytics/* for CRUD operations.
- Implement proper error handling and authentication/authorization checks.
- Add support for both mock data services and database operations.

Data Fetching & Validation:
- Implement React Query for efficient data fetching and caching.
- Use Zod for validating API requests and responses.

Phase 6: Enhanced Dashboard Features [In Progress]

Implement advanced chart visualizations:
- Project progress tracking charts
- Budget comparison charts
- Resource allocation visualizations
- Time tracking analytics

Add interactive data displays:
- Filterable and sortable data tables
- Drag-and-drop capabilities for tasks
- Interactive calendars for deadlines and milestones

Implement role-specific dashboards:
- Admin: Overall system analytics, user management stats
- Team: Task assignments, productivity metrics
- Client: Project status, budget tracking

Phase 7: Enhanced Functionality

Enhance authentication:
- Add password reset features
- Implement secure session management
- Support social login options

Improve collaboration features:
- Add a rich text editor for comments
- Implement file sharing and document management
- Create team chat or discussion threads

Role-Specific Enhancements:
- Admin: User and role management, project overviews, audit logs, and system analytics.
- Client: Project progress tracking, budget monitoring, support ticket system, document sharing, and meeting scheduling.
- Team: Task management, time tracking, document management, and collaboration features.

Phase 8: Advanced Features & Optimizations

Implement a drag-and-drop Kanban board for streamlined task management.
Enable customizable dashboard widgets with drag-and-drop and collapsible panels.
Integrate built-in time tracking and produce productivity/billing reports.
Set up automated in-app/email notifications for project updates and deadlines.
Optimize the design for mobile-first experiences and add Progressive Web App (PWA) support.
Develop robust API endpoints for third-party integrations (e.g., CRM, ERP).

Database Migration:
- Transition from mock data to a real database.
- Design proper database models, manage migrations, and optimize relationships.
- Implement data integrity measures, backups, and recovery strategies.

Performance & Deployment:
- Ensure page load times under 2 seconds and target 99.9% uptime.
- Achieve over 80% automated test coverage (unit, integration, end-to-end).
- Configure a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions, deploy on Vercel, and manage environment-specific configurations.

Security Measures:
- Enforce HTTPS, sanitize all inputs, implement rate limiting, and setup CSRF protection.
- Conduct regular security audits.

Documentation:
- Provide comprehensive API documentation (e.g., with Swagger)
- Detailed technical documentation including design diagrams and user guides
- Developer setup guide, deployment instructions, and contribution guidelines.

Next Steps:
1. Complete the Enhanced Dashboard Features with improved data visualizations
2. Implement Kanban board for task management
3. Add in-app notification system
4. Set up email notifications for important events
5. Add file upload and document management
6. Implement real-time collaboration features

Requirements:

Use Next.js 14 with the App Router.
Follow a dark-themed UI design as specified.
Adhere to modern web development best practices for scalability and security.
Incorporate extensive testing (unit, integration, and E2E).
Document the code and overall architecture in detail.
